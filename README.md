python-rtsp
===========

This is a quick and dirty project using the excellent python-rtsp library (https://github.com/odie5533/Python-RTSP)
to make a headless RTP session, dump the SDP info and keep the session alive. I would recommend no one else uses this,
as it is a gross hack to meet my specific needs.
